# Notes

Brief design notes and architectural thinking behind select projects.

Not every decision is visible in code. This folder captures the reasoning, trade-offs, and design choices that shaped specific projects. These are not formal documents. They are working notes written to make intent explicit and to preserve context that code alone cannot convey.

## What to expect

- Short design decision records
- Architectural trade-off notes
- Observations from building and iterating
- Reflections on patterns that worked and those that did not
