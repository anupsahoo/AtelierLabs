# Agents

Self-contained agent projects. Each agent has a clear purpose, defined inputs, and observable behavior.

Every project in this folder represents an autonomous system that can perceive its environment, reason about what it observes, and take deliberate action. Agents here are designed to be small, readable, and complete. They are not fragments of a larger system.

## What to expect

- Each agent lives in its own subfolder
- Entry points are clearly named
- Decision logic is separated from execution
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints are explicit where present
