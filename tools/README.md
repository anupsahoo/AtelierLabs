# Tools

Utilities and integrations that agents use to interact with the outside world.

An agent without tools can only reason. An agent with tools can act. This folder contains the interfaces, adapters, and utilities that give agents the ability to read from external sources, write to systems, and execute real actions. Each tool is designed to be composable and independently testable.

## What to expect

- Tool definitions with clear input and output contracts
- Adapters for external APIs and services
- Shared utilities used across agent projects
- Patterns for safe and reversible tool execution
