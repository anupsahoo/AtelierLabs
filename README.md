# AtelierLabs

AtelierLabs is a workshop of thoughtfully designed AI agent systems and intelligent automation projects. Each project is small by design, built to demonstrate how autonomous systems can reason, decide, and act in real-world contexts. This is not a collection of experiments or demos. It is a space where working code communicates intent, architecture, and trade-offs clearly. Learning here happens by reading and understanding the code itself, not through tutorials or walkthroughs.

## Philosophy

Every project in this repository begins with a question worth answering and a decision worth automating. The guiding principles are straightforward:

- **Intent before implementation.** Understand the problem deeply before writing a single line.
- **Simplicity as a discipline.** Small systems that do one thing well are more valuable than large systems that do many things poorly.
- **Responsibility in autonomy.** Agents that act on behalf of people must be transparent, predictable, and correctable.
- **Craftsmanship over scale.** A well-structured fifty-line agent teaches more than a sprawling framework.
- **Human judgment where it matters.** Full autonomy is not always the goal. Knowing when to defer to a person is a design decision.

These are not aspirational statements. They are constraints that shape every project here.

## What You Will Find Here

- Autonomous agents that observe, reason, and take action within defined boundaries
- Decision orchestration systems that coordinate multiple steps toward a clear outcome
- Knowledge-aware agents that retrieve, interpret, and apply information in context
- Workflow intelligence that brings structure and adaptability to multi-step processes
- Tool-using agents that interact with external systems and APIs with purpose
- Code-first learning examples that make agent design patterns tangible and readable
- Human-in-the-loop designs where oversight is built into the system, not bolted on

## How Learning Works Here

There are no courses, no step-by-step guides, and no exercises. Each project is a self-contained codebase that speaks for itself. The structure of the code, the naming of components, and the flow of decisions are all intentional.

Readers who want to understand agent systems should start by reading the code slowly. Pay attention to how responsibilities are separated, how decisions are made, and where the system chooses to pause and involve a human. The patterns will become clear through repeated exposure to well-structured examples. Understanding comes from studying the choices made, not from following instructions.

```

- **agents** — Self-contained agent projects. Each agent has a clear purpose, defined inputs, and observable behavior.
- **orchestration** — Systems that coordinate multiple agents or steps to achieve a broader outcome.
- **knowledge** — Projects focused on retrieval, context management, and information-aware reasoning.
- **tools** — Utilities and integrations that agents use to interact with the outside world.
- **notes** — Brief design notes and architectural thinking behind select projects.

## How to Navigate

Start with any project that matches your interest. Each folder is independent and self-explanatory. Read the code from the entry point forward, following the flow of data and decisions. There is no required order and no prerequisites. The repository is designed to reward curiosity and careful reading.
