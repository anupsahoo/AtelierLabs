# Orchestration

Systems that coordinate multiple agents or steps to achieve a broader outcome.

Projects here focus on how independent components work together. Orchestration is about sequencing, routing, and managing the flow of decisions across boundaries. These are not monolithic pipelines. They are composed systems where each part has a clear role.

## What to expect

- Multi-step workflows with defined handoff points
- Coordination patterns between agents and tools
- Error handling and fallback strategies
- Clear separation between planning and execution
